/**
 * interface RangedList
 *
 * RangedList is a specialized List that allows efficient ranking and counting of
 * elements relative to a fixed, sorted range of allowed values. It ensures all
 * list elements must be present in the range, and it extends Index for efficient
 * primitive access. Key features include methods for counting occurrences (count()),
 * computing cumulative counts (cumulativeCounts()), and determining ranks (ranks())
 * of list elements based on the fixed range. This makes RangedList suitable for
 * applications like histogram-style analysis and rank computations.

/**
 * A {@code RangedList} is a {@link java.util.List} that supports efficient ranking and
 * counting of its elements relative to a fixed, sorted range of allowed values.
 *
 * <p>The range defines the set of valid, comparable elements and may include values
 * that do not appear in the list. The range must be sorted in ascending order (either
 * naturally or via a comparator) and contain no duplicates.
 *
 * <p>This interface enables histogram-style analysis and rank computations by using
 * the range as a canonical reference frame. All elements in the list must be contained
 * in the range. Implementations are expected to enforce this invariant.
 *
 * <p>{@code RangedList} also extends the {@link Index} interface, allowing direct access
 * to the list's contents as primitive values using methods like {@code intValue(int)} and
 * {@code longValue(int)}. This is especially useful for numerical data (e.g., {@code byte},
 * {@code short}, {@code int}, {@code long}) where boxing and unboxing would be inefficient.
 *
 * <p>For example, given the list: {@code [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]} and a fixed range:
 * {@code [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code ranks()} returns {@code [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3]} â€” the same as the list itself
 *       since each element's rank matches its value in a zero-based, sorted range.</li>
 *   <li>{@code cumulativeCounts()} returns {@code [0, 2, 1, 3, 0]}</li>
 *   <li>{@code count(4)} returns {@code 0}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements in this list and its range
